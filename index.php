                    <p>Science is what we do to find out about the natural world. Natural sciences include physics,
                        chemistry, biology, geology and astronomy.
                        Science uses mathematics and logic, which are sometimes called "formal sciences". Natural
                        science makes observations and experiments.
                        Science produces accurate facts, scientific laws and theories.'Science' also refers to the large
                        amount of knowledge that has been found using this process.</p>
                    <p>People who study and research science and try to find out everything about it are called
                        scientists. Scientists study things by looking at them very carefully, by measuring them, and by
                        doing experiments and tests. Scientists try to explain why things act the way they do, and
                        predict what will happen.</p>
